# Bookmarker

This is a basic bookmark page. It writes its bookmarks to a single JSON file in
the same directory as its index file, so therefore it is well suited to being
stored in a Dropbox directory - from there, of course, you can access your
bookmarks from any computer which you've set up with your Dropbox account.
